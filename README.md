## 📈 Sequence Workflow Overview

The project follows a clean MVC pattern where the frontend interacts with the backend to fetch or update data from the database. Here's the overall flow:

1. **Login** – User logs in; credentials validated via database.
2. **Dashboard** – User is redirected to dashboard with user-specific data.
3. **View Details** – Fetch and display gym, membership, members, payments, and trainers using database queries.
